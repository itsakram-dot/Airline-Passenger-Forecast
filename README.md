## Forecasting Airline Passenger Traffic with Time Series Analysis (ARIMA)

### Overview
This project analyzes historical airline passenger data (1949-1960) to predict future passenger demand using time series forecasting techniques (Holt-Winters ETS, ARIMA). The ARIMA model achieved superior accuracy (MAPE: 1.00%, RMSE: 0.0662), making it the preferred choice for airline passenger forecasting.

### Project Highlights
- **Techniques:** ARIMA, Holt-Winters ETS, Time Series Decomposition
- **Tools Used:** R (forecast package), Data Visualization, Excel
- **Dataset:** [Airline Passenger Dataset (1949-1960)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakannimer/air-passengers)

### Files Included
- `AirPassengers.csv`: Original data set
- `673 Project.R`: R script with detailed forecasting steps and models
- `Project Report.pdf`: Comprehensive report outlining methodology, results, and business insights

### Key Results
- Successfully predicted airline passenger growth, informing decisions in capacity planning and revenue management.
- Provided critical insights for operational efficiency in airline industry applications.
